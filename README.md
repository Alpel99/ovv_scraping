# 🏐 Volleyball Match Calendar

A simple web application to **view, filter, and download volleyball match schedules** from scraped data.  
Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** .

## ✨ Features

- **Filter matches** by:
  - 🏆 League  
  - 🧍‍♂️ Team  
  - 📅 Start date  

- **Add multiple filters** (each displayed as a removable filter “chip”)
    - the result of each filter is added to the list
    - more filters are not more restrictive, but the opposite
- **Interactive calendar view** powered by [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/)
- **Download matches as `.ics` (calendar) files**
- Lightweight — all data handled in the frontend

## 🗓️ Usage

    * https://alpel99.github.io/ovv_scraping/frontend
1. Use the dropdowns and date picker to define filters.
1. Click “Add Filter” to build a list of search filters.
1. Click “Run Filters” to display the filtered events in the calendar.
1. Download results as an .ics file for your personal calendar.

## 🧩 How It Works
### Scheduled / Manual Trigger:
A GitHub Action runs automatically every 12 hours, or can be triggered manually (via the "Run workflow" button or /rescrape comment).

### Scraping Step:
The Action installs dependencies and runs scraper/main.py, which collects calendar data and saves it as frontend/schedule.json.
This takes a lot of time just because for timeouts to not trigger any rate limits from the volleyscore website.

### Data Publishing:
After scraping, the workflow switches to the gh-pages branch and commits the updated schedule.json file.

### Frontend Access:
The website hosted on GitHub Pages fetches schedule.json directly from the published branch and displays the latest data.

### 🔧 Data Generation (Scraper)

The `schedule.json` file is automatically generated by a **Python web scraper** that collects match data from volleyball competition pages.

- Uses **BeautifulSoup** and **cloudscraper** to extract HTML safely (even behind Cloudflare).
- Reads match tables and collects:
  - 🏷️ `teams` — both teams  
  - 📍 `location` — match venue (from the table or details page)  
  - 📅 `dateT` — combined date & time in ISO 8601 format (readable by JavaScript)  
  - 🔗 `link` — original match page URL  
  - 🏆 `league` — extracted from the page or competition ID  
- Only includes **upcoming matches** (where no final score exists).
- Writes all matches into a clean `schedule.json` list for use by the frontend.

## 🧰 Future Improvements
- Add search by location
- Auto-refresh when data.json changes
- Mobile-friendly filter sidebar

- Even more leagues?
